Rows 1-4 of Table 1 show that simply increasing the batch size by a factor of 8 improves the state-of-the-art IS by 46%. We conjecture that this is a result of each batch covering more modes, providing better gradients for both networks. One notable side effect of this scaling is that our models reach better final performance in fewer iterations, but become unstable and undergo complete training collapse.\n",
