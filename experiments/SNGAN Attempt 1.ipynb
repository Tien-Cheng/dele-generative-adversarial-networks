Rows 1-4 of Table 1 show that simply increasing the batch size by a factor of 8 improves the state-of-the-art IS by 46%. We conjecture that this is a result of each batch covering more modes, providing better gradients for both networks. One notable side effect of this scaling is that our models reach better final performance in fewer iterations, but become unstable and undergo complete training collapse.\n",

        "As a result of their findings, I will try and use as large a batch size as possible, within the limitations of the GPU memory. To increase my batch size further, I can make use of gradient accumulation, which is helpfully implemented in PyTorch Lightning's Trainers, to accumulate the gradients from backprogagation over multiple batches, resulting in an increased effective batch size\n"
