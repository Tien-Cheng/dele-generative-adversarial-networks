Rows 1-4 of Table 1 show that simply increasing the batch size by a factor of 8 improves the state-of-the-art IS by 46%. We conjecture that this is a result of each batch covering more modes, providing better gradients for both networks. One notable side effect of this scaling is that our models reach better final performance in fewer iterations, but become unstable and undergo complete training collapse.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result of their findings, I will try and use as large a batch size as possible, within the limitations of the GPU memory. To increase my batch size further, I can make use of gradient accumulation, which is helpfully implemented in PyTorch Lightning's Trainers, to accumulate the gradients from backprogagation over multiple batches, resulting in an increased effective batch size\n"

        "To improve my conditional DCGAN, I introduce some improvements\n",
        "### Label Smoothing\n",
        "One of the ways to improve the training of the GAN, as recommended by Goodfellow, “NIPS 2016 Tutorial.” ﻿ is to replace the positive classification target of the discriminator when working with real images (a value of 1, corresponding to a real image), with a smoothed value like 0.9. This prevents the discriminator from being too confident in it's predictions, reducing vulnerability to adversarial examples created by the generator.\n",
        "In this case, I set the label smoothing hyperparameter as 0.1.\n",
        "\n",
        "### R1 Regularization\n",
        "One of the ways to regularize the discriminator is to perform R1 regularization. R1 regularization tries to enforce the Nash Equilibrium (the optimal solution when training a GAN when both the generator and discriminator are no longer able to improve), by penalizing the gradient on real data alone. If the generator performs well (discovering the actual data distribution), we want to ensure that the discriminator does not create a gradient that will cause the generator to create something outside that distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Spectral Normalization\n",
        "To further stabilize the training of the discriminator network, I attempt to introduce spectral normalization. Spectral normalization is a weight normalization method that attempts to enforce Lipschitz continuity in the network. Lipschitz continuity means that for a given function, the magnitude of its gradient should be at most K for every point.\n",
        "\n",
        "The actual result of the network having Lipschitz continuity is that it constrains the gradients in the network (by enforcing an upper bound to the gradients). As a result spectral normalization reduces the risk of exploding gradients during training. In addition, spectral normalization controls the variance of the weights in the network, helping to prevent the vanishing gradient problem.
